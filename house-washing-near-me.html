Moss retains moisture, which can seep into roofing materials and lead to rot or mold. However, this method requires careful application by experienced hands to avoid potential harm to roofing materials or nearby vegetation. <br><br>  Use a soft-bristled brush or broom to gently sweep away loose moss without damaging the shingles beneath it. The size and pitch of your roof significantly impact the price, as larger or steeper roofs pose more challenges and require additional time and effort to clean. This method serves as an excellent preventative measure without involving harsh chemicals. <br><br></p>
